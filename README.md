#Gameframe
Game header and footers.

Put your game inside the frame by editing the iframe tag

It's located inside the `game` div

```html
<iframe src="yourgamepath" height="" width=""></iframe>
```

> Note

**Do not** try to change other paths or tags and merge the frame elements eg. `css` with that in your folder.

Use two different folders one for the frame and the other for your game
