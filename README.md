#Gameframe
Game header and footers.

Put your game inside the frame by editing the iframe tag

It's located inside the `game` div

```html
<iframe src="yourgamepath" height="" width=""></iframe>
```

> Note

**Do not** try to change other paths or tags and merge the frame elements eg. `css` with that in your folder.

Two different folders one for the frame and the other for your game

The `CSS` file you'll should be editing is the `game.css`. You can

* Choose alignment of the frame
* Change background image ( Do change the original background )
* Choose from 7 preloaders or add your own looping `gif`
